Welcome to year 2095. We are now living inside space-cities around 3.8 lightyears from Earth since our planet was completely dominated by Pluto's cyborg chimpanzees. We're also, as you should know, in the middle of the Fifth Suprasupercluster War.</br>

Feel the rush of being part of the acclaimed SPHFS/18 - Special Plasma Heavy Force Squad 18, and save us from the terrifying Y-23A Zorg, a mach-80 strobotic hypersonic magnetic cannon weapon. And remember: you can always be a SIGMA! :medal_military:
